                Taste and See Coffee Shop and Gallery offers a unique coffee house <br>
                environment unlike any other in Macon. We are not only a place to drop <br>
                in and get your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than <br>
                welcome to do that), we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy <br>
                that tailor-made cup of coffee. If you need to work, we have a seating area <br>
                created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area <br>
                in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body. <br>
                We look forward to serving you at Taste & See Coffee Shop and Gallery!
